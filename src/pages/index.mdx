Iâ€™m a 21-year-old full-stack developer currently based in <Badge type="flag_ch" label="Switzerland" />. I work with web technologies daily, but I also enjoy tinkering with hardware and lower-level programming languages in my spare time.

## Blog

For a long time I've been writing small drafts in my <Badge type="obsidian" href="https://obsidian.md/" /> vault and just recently I decided to polish and publish some of them to see how it goes. Have a read!

_Pssst! I also have an <Badge label="RSS" type="rss" href="/rss.xml"  /> feed!_

<Badge type="neovim" href="https://neovim.io"/> is my text editor of choice, using a slightly modified version of [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/). All my dotfiles can be found [here on GitHub](https://github.com/gigantino/rice).

I've been using Linux for around 10 years (with Ubuntu 13.10 being the first distro I've ever installed). <Badge label="Arch" type="arch-linux" href="https://archlinux.org" /> has been my daily driver for the past three years. I'm looking forward to experimenting with [Void](https://voidlinux.org/) in the near future.
