# hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 20 year old full-stack developer currently based in Europe. I mostly work
with <Badge type="nuxt" href="https://nuxt.com/" /> and <Badge type="typescript" href="https://typescriptlang.org/" />
on a day to day basis, but in my spare time I enjoy trying out new technologies and tinkering with hardware.

<Links />

I enjoy writing articles about technical challanges that I've had the chance to delve into.

<Posts />

Actually, I have tens of drafs stored in my <Badge type="obsidian" href="https://obsidian.md/" /> vault,
with most of them being used as a personal backlog that almost never end up seeing the
light of the day.
