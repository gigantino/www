# hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 20 year old full-stack developer currently based in Europe.

I enjoy writing articles about technical challanges that I've had the chance to delve into.

<Posts />

Actually, I have tens of drafs stored in my [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault,
but most them are just used as a personal backlog and almost never end up seeing the
light of the day.
