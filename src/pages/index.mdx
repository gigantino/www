# hello world! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 20 year old full-stack developer currently based in Europe. I work with
web technologies like <Badge type="nuxt" href="https://nuxt.com/" />
and <Badge label="TypeScript" type="typescript" href="https://typescriptlang.org/" />
on a daily basis, but in my spare time I also enjoy tinkering with hardware and lower-level
programming languages.

<Badge type="neovim" href="https://neovim.io"/> is my text-editor of choice, using a
slightly modified version of [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/). You can find all my configs
[here on GitHub](https://github.com/gigantino/rice).

Also, I've been using Linux for around 10 years (with Ubuntu 13.10 being the first distro I've ever
installed on my local machine). <Badge label="Arch" type="arch-linux" href="https://archlinux.org" />
has been my daily driver for the past three years. I'm looking forward to experimenting
with [Void](https://voidlinux.org/) in the near future.

In my spare time I like making the drafts stored in
my <Badge type="obsidian" href="https://obsidian.md/" /> vault come to life by writing
in-depth articles about technical challanges I've had the chance to delve into.
Have a read!

(Pssst! I also have an <Badge label="RSS" type="rss" href="/rss.xml"  /> feed!)


I like listening to <Badge type="spotify" href="https://spotify.com" />
<Spotify client:load />


Also, I have a PGP key!
