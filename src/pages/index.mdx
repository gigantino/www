I'm a full-stack developer with over 5 years of experience under my belt, currently based in Geneva, Switzerland.

I work with web technologies daily, and I also enjoy tinkering with hardware and lower-level programming languages in my spare time.

## Writing

1. [How I made an AI-generated show](/blog/ai-generated-show) — They weren't joking when they said that, in the future, entertainment would be artificially generated. <span style="color: var(--color-muted-foreground);">October 17, 2023</span>
2. [Automating lighthouse reports with Unlighthouse](/blog/unlighthouse) — Build a CI/CD with GitHub actions to track your lighthouse scores. <span style="color: var(--color-muted-foreground);">October 10, 2023</span>

I also have an [RSS](/rss.xml) feed.

## Projects

1. [Delizioso](https://delizioso.app) — The SaaS for restaurants I'm currently working on.
